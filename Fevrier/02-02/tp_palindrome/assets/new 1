Day in the life of a web developer

Everyday starts the same way. I enter the office and greet my colleagues. We spend the beginning of our day discussing everyday life, further we have a short meeting where we discuss our projects, and what we have achieved so far. The coordinator also shares his views on current state of the project and what could be changed or reworked.

Then, until the lunch break, I spend all my time working on the project, either doing backend, coding server-side, or frontend, creating web pages in html/css and a little bit of javascript. I occasionally help my colleagues with their issues, so that we can move forward at the same pace.

Lunch break is me eating something delicious in the lunch room, something that is worth all the time spent in front of the pc. I also talk to my colleagues about something that isn't serious, to relax a little bit and get my mind off the work. 

Next part of the day is the same as the part before luch break. I spend my time doing the same thing, ocasionally helping my colleagues and asking for help too if I need it.

By evening I commit all my changes to our local repository, I warn our CTO that my job for today is done and that I am going home, say goodbye to everyone and leave.
